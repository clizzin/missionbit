# The 9 Blocks Challenge

Your goal is to use HTML and CSS to __make a web page with 9 colored square `<div>`s arranged in a 3 by 3 grid__.

This is going to be difficult! Don't worry, your instructor (and the internet) is here to help.

### What's a `<div>`?
A `<div>` is an HTML tag, like `<h1>` or `<p>`. By itself, the `<div>` tag is totally invisible. You'll have to figure out what CSS to use to make it appear for real.

### What's the point?
The whole point of this challenge is to practice __these 3 things__:
1) Writing HTML and CSS (duh)
2) __Searching up how to do things__ with HTML/CSS that you don't know how to do (less obvious)
3) Breaking a large difficult task down into smaller chunks (way less obvious)

### Steps

#### Getting Started

0) Create a new directory on your desktop called `9-blocks-challenge`.

1) Create an `index.html` file in that directory that looks like this:

```html
<!doctype HTML>
<html>
    <body></body>
</html>
```

#### 9 Blocks Challenge

Now it is time for the challenge!

0) First, spend 3-5 minutes to discuss as a class how to break this task down into smaller pieces. This is an extremely important skill that software engineers have to use every single day.

1) Once you have decided on a plan of action, start working! Make sure you read the notes below this step:

__Remember that one of the main goals of this challenge is to practice searching up how to do things on your own.__ Don't be afraid to ask your instructor for help when you are stuck, but really try your hardest to find the answer on your own first.

__Don't forget about your friend the web inspector.__

__Be patient with yourself__. This is not supposed to be easy.
